📱 Touristo is an innovative mobile Android-based project that was developed in collaboration with a dedicated team of four members: thiviru maneth , Wayani Jayawardhana , isuru supun , and Mohommad Shabeer . 🌍 This project aims to revolutionize tourist management in Sri Lanka by providing a comprehensive solution for tourists and administrators.

🔐 The project was built using Kotlin and Android Studio, harnessing the power of these technologies to create a robust and scalable application. QR code validations were implemented to ensure secure staff authentication, while the Room Persistence Database guarantees efficient and reliable data storage.
